# evtail

### Real-time console event log tracker for Windows

This project is designed to provide a command-line interface (like unix's 'tail -f') to the Windows Event Log.

An example:

C:\Projects\evtail>evtail System 2006-08-10 00:03:40 SANITY -> RemoteAccess Information: The connection to Dodo made by user samgentle using device COM3 was disconnected.

2006-08-10 01:00:58 SANITY -> RemoteAccess Information: The user samgentle successfully established a connection to Dodo using the device COM3.
